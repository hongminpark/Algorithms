### README
This is python Algorithm code repository.<br>
The study is based on the lecture [Minseok Heo's Inflearn course]("https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EC%BD%94%EB%94%A9-%EC%9D%B8%ED%84%B0%EB%B7%B0/") which is very simple and helpful.<br>
You can also take his course on the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rXy58SlsEE&list=PLVNY1HnUlO24PIx4k45VnEySkygjxGQwB)<br>
Codes are referenced from [Mindeok Heo's lecture code](https://github.com/minsuk-heo/problemsolving/).<br>
I highlly recommend his course if you are zero-status of Algorithm and Data-Structure
